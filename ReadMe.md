Title: Chat Room

Description: Chat Room is a simple chat application developed with the intent of having the first contact with WebSockets. The project was initiated through the tutorial found on the socket.io web page (https://socket.io/get-started/chat). After the first phase being completed, I reshaped the app to have a more appealing design, as well a few more features.

Features: Chat room allows the users to enter a username and send messages to each other. The name of the person that sent the message is also displayed before the message.

Use: the app can be accessed using the following url:
